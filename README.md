## ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork
Apply convolutional neural network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes 10 labels -- airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck:
* Preprocess data by normalizing pixel features, one-hot encoding labels, randomizing the order of samples.
